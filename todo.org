* Inbox
** TODO Create the Event Model with beam with an auto-increment key and create monadic interfaces to insert a user into the db and query a user from the db
- https://haskell-beam.github.io/beam/tutorials/tutorial2/

[[file:~/code/yasmp/src/Models/Event.hs::module Models.Event where]]
** TODO Create monads to insert Events/Users into the database

[[file:~/code/yasmp/src/DB.hs::aggregateUsers :: IO ()]]
* Projects
** Proj Create basic CRUD functionality for small events(MVP, using basic technologies only, like scotty and sqlite-simple)
*** [ ] Add a database(sqlite) to the project. Check the Deep Work nix file(or my bookmarks) for the tutorial on how to do it

[[file:~/code/yasmp/app/Main.hs::html $ mconcat \["<h1>Hello, ", word, "!</h1>"\]]]
*** [ ] Work on the API(and pages) for creating and deleting events
- Maybe do the thing where if you request for HTML, you get HTML, and if you request for JSON you get JSON
** Proj Transition to a frontend framework, using purescript(or elm, but most likely purescript)
** Proj As I get better at haskell, transition to something more robust like Servant(for all the type-level goodies)
* Backlog
** Idea Add a feature where users can tag events, and allow people to find events by tag
** Idea People can also search for events by keyword too
** Idea Add a modal to warn people of the dangers of going out with strangers
** Idea Allow people to filter for the times when they are free(conflict resolution, you can enter times you are free and filter)
** Idea Add authentication to authenticate users
** Idea Allow people to create private groups(for a friend group or something)
- People might only want to use the app with people they trust
- Maybe a friend in the group has a random idea for an event, so we can add features for conflict resolution and such
** Idea Allow people to add public events where anyone(account or not) can join in
- Allows you to meet new people easily
** Idea Add private communities where only verified users can sign up for an account(I don't want my app to be the cause for murders lol)
- So that users in the same community(but are not particularly close) can find events to bond over
* Finished tasked
** DONE Add testing with Quickcheck and Hspec and learned a little bit how Quickcheck works
